# rubiks-cube
My thesis project about Rubik cubes and algorithms to solve it

## Frontend

The frontend consists of an editor and a simulator part. The editor is an integrated Monaco editor with two tabs.
The simulator is based on [this repository](https://github.com/taylorjg/rubiks-cube). I modified the code so it is easier to integrate into my project.

## Credits

Thanks to [Jonathan Taylor](https://github.com/taylorjg), for licensing his project, so I can use his code!
