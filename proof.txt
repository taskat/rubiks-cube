number of cycles even <==> number of even length cycles even

=>
    odd number of corner cycles & odd number of edge cycles
        corner
            sum of corner cycle length will be even (8)
                if there would be even number of even length, these sum would be even
                but number of cycles is odd => odd number of odd length cycles
                sum of even cycle lengths is even
                sum of odd cycle lengths is odd
                even + odd = odd, but this is a contradiction
                => number of even corner cycles will be odd 
        edge
            sum of edge cycle length will be even (12)
                if there would be even number of even length, these sum would be even
                but number of cycles is odd => odd number of odd length cycles
                sum of even cycle lengths is even
                sum of odd cycle lengths is odd
                even + odd = odd, but this is a contradiction
                => number of even edge cycles will be odd 
        odd + odd = even, we are good
    even number of corner cycles & even number of edge cycles
        corner
            sum of corner cycle length will be even (8)
                the number of odd length cycles will be even, otherwise the sum would be odd
                even - even = even
                => the number of even length corner cycle is even
        edge
            sum of edge cycle length will be even (8)
                the number of odd length cycles will be even, otherwise the sum would be odd
                even - even = even
                => the number of even length edge cycle is even
        even + even = even, we are good
    both paths good, this direction is valid
